![Image Alt Text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dmlaqelqw/image/upload/v1690631332/Screenshot_75_y48hix.png)


## Overview

This repository contains a clone of the Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum blockchain. The Uniswap clone aims to replicate the core functionality of the original Uniswap platform, allowing users to swap Ethereum-based tokens directly from their wallets.

## Features

- Swap Functionality: Users can swap one Ethereum-based token for another through a simple and intuitive interface.

- Liquidity Provision: Liquidity providers can add tokens to the platform's liquidity pool and earn fees from trades.

- Automated Market Maker (AMM): The platform utilizes an AMM algorithm to determine token prices based on the ratio of reserves in the liquidity pool.

- Decentralized: The Uniswap clone operates on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency, security, and non-custodial trading.

- Web3 Integration: The platform integrates with Web3 wallets like MetaMask to provide a seamless user experience.

## Getting Started

To run the Uniswap clone locally or deploy it to a test network, follow these steps:

1. Prerequisites: Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

2. Clone the Repository: Clone this Git repository to your local machine using the following command:



3. Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies with npm:



4. Configure Ethereum Node: Connect the Uniswap clone to an Ethereum node. You can use a local development node or connect to a test network like Ropsten or Rinkeby.

5. Compile and Deploy Smart Contracts: Compile and deploy the smart contracts to the chosen Ethereum network.

6. Set Up Frontend: Create a frontend interface to interact with the smart contracts. Use technologies like React.js or similar frameworks.

7. Test: Thoroughly test the platform's functionality and security to ensure a smooth user experience.
